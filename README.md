## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **try the site on a local machine.**

    You will need a Contentful account and create a .env.development file in the root folder with your id and and acces token.

1.  **Start developing.**

    Run gatsby develop

1.  **See the site!**

    My site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   

## 🧐 What's inside?

    This site was developed using the default gatsby starter and using Sass modules for the CSS.

    It is sometimes tweaked as it is the site I use to try new things so some of it might be broken.

## 🔎 Do you have any jobs?

    I am looking for a junior role as a web developer and I am also looking at becoming a cloud engineer
    If you have any tips or even a job for me, please do not hesitate to contact me.
